The Best Pokemon Box system ever invented

An app that can be used to create, name and store your teams and custom Pokemon.

Once you open the app, ensure you log in to save your teams and select your favourite pokemon! 

You can create as many teams as you like and store them with any Pokemon up to the most recent generation!

The initial index page will display a list of your teams showing you the sprite of each pokemon within your named team.

Fill your box with pokemon and customize their stats, attacks, held items and names for use in your teams.
