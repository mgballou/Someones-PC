The Best Pokemon Box system ever invented

An app that can be used to create, name and store your teams and Pokemon.

Once you have loaded up the app, please log in. This ensures that all features are available for you to enjoy.

First, you'll want to click on your username. Once there, you will be able to select your favorite Pokemon. Look out for them on the navigation bar! 

Next, please select "box", from this page you will see a list of all the pokemon you have created. First time here? well then it's time to create them! select "create new Pokemon" to do just that! 

Once here you have a few options. First, you can type in the name or Pokedex number of your favorite Pokemon. Currently we are limited to "Miraidon" #1008 however as more pokemon get released we'll ensure to keep the database updated.

Unsure who you want to select? choose the "Random Pokemon" option and we'll choose a random Pokemon for you! Once you have created your Pokemon you'll return to the Box which will display every Pokemon you have created so far! 

Changed your mind on a Pokemon in your Box? Select "Release Pokemon" and we'll release your Pokemon back into the wild. 

Want more information on your Pokemon? Click on their sprite to be taken to their personal details paige. From here, you'll be able to change their name to a nickname of your choice! 

Ready for battle? Head over to "View Teams" and select "Create New Team". This will take you to a page to first name your team, then set up your team ready to take on the Pokemon world. Select up to 6 teams for your party by selecting their sprite. Be aware, that as these are unique Pokemon you can only add each individual to your party once. If you want a dream team of 6 Bulbasaur in your party (because who wouldn't?) make sure that you create 6 Bulbasaur on the Pokemon creation page.

Soon we will be looking to impliment the ability to display and edit further details on your Pokemon, such as held items, typing, ability, attacks and base stats.
