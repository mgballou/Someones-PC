The Best Pokemon Box system ever invented

An app that can be used to create, name and store your  team in Pokemon.

You can create as many teams as you like and store them with any Pokemon up to the most recent generation of Pokemon.

The initial index page will display a list of your teams showing you the sprite of each pokemon within your named team.

Once you click on your desired team, It will then display further information about each pokemon that you have selected, including their attacks, HP, stats etc. 

All of this data will be generated on selection however it can be edited to match the team you currently own in game.
