Conditonal display for logged in/not logged in

redirect after adding pokemon- done

on the teams index - each team is held in a div with the images of the pokemon 
team show page

teams controller needs to populate it's pokemon before passing the context - done
the sprites will be availble to inject in templates with teams.pokemon[i].sprite

(on a show page team.pokemon[i].sprite)

96x96 pixels by default for sprites


conditional logic on the show page - show the 6 pokemon
if there are not six pokemon
show (6-current number of pokemon) boxes


pokemon edit page
update the model to have something to edit - done with nickname
pull in the current information for the pokemon selected
display it in an empty form
submit button will send a PUT request to /???




create - teams, pokemon
read - teams, pokemon(box - pokemon index)
update - editing pokemon records (give pokemon a nickname value, and create the edit page)
Delete - delete team button on Show page, & remove/delete buttons on individual pokemon (for now, remove from database)
             i ended up removing the pokemon from the team, and refactoring the pokemon model to better match the intended structure
